# sentiment-analysis-on-twitter-API-using-python

This is capstone project of my Masters program that I did on Summer 2022. The goal of the project is to perform sentiments analysis and create word cloud of tweets with hashtag \#Ukraine. For that I used Python on **Jupiter lab** environment.

Repository contains two *.ipynb* files:

-   **Ukraine_small_data_collection_Nurmanov.ipynb** - the code contains data collection of 10,000 tweets, text cleaning, sentiment analysis, word cloud. [Elevated access]{.ul} of Twitter API required.

-   **Ukraine_analysis_Nurmanov.ipynb** - this code doesn't retrieve any from Twitter API. Instead it opens *csv* files with already downloaded tweets. Because my professor has [Academic Research]{.ul} level, he has an access for full-archive. The code does text cleaning, sentiment analysis and word cloud. Data contains **2,780,000** entries (tweets.
